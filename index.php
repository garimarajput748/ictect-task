                <p>XML is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting,and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. However, XML is not intuitive and requires specialized training. It is frequently outsourced to experts who know the language and must be hired to further manage the content.</p>
                <p>In organizations where XML workflows are used, Ictect software offers a unique value proposition to enable authors, editors, publishers and everyone in the content supply chain to use Microsoft Word and Office 365 to create and edit XML.
